HOW TO BUILD AND DOWNLOAD YOUR CGPA CALCULATOR APK

EASIEST METHOD: Build directly from Expo Dashboard
-------------------------------------------------
1. Visit https://expo.dev/ and sign in with your account (siamrana2321)
2. Go to your project: https://expo.dev/accounts/siamrana2321/projects/cgpa-calculator
3. Click "Build" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Create new build"
5. Select "Android"
6. Choose "APK (.apk)" as the build type
7. Select "apk" profile (we've created this specifically for APK builds)
8. Click "Create build"
9. Wait for the build to complete (5-10 minutes)
10. Download the APK by clicking the "Download" button

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:
- If the build fails, check the logs by clicking on the build and examining each phase
- Make sure your React version is 18.2.0 (which we've already updated) to match React Native's requirements
- Try creating a new build with different profiles ("preview" or "apk")
- If all else fails, you can use Expo Go to test your app without building an APK

Your app is already configured for APK builds with this eas.json configuration:

    "preview": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk",
        "withoutCredentials": true
      }
    }
  }
}
